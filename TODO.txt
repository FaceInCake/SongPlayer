- Staccato (dot symbol above note)
  > Shorten note duration but not atom duration, (aka, play sharply)

- Fermata (circle with semi-circle above it)
  > Prolong atom by some fraction, (aka, hold pause)
- Tie (curved line between notes of same pitch)
  > Note gains duration of the sum of the notes, while atom maintains duration
- Casesura (two angled dashes at the top of a measure)
  > Brief pause that's off rhythm, like a silent fermata, but shorter
- Dotted (small dot after note)
  > atom duration *= 1.5, two dots = 1.75, 3=1.875
- Pedal (looks like Leo, but it says Ped. below measure)
  > note duration is extended up until a set point, atom duration unaffected
  > All currently held down notes have their durations extended
  > All base notes have their durations extended
 
- Flag ???? (beams on notes) ((beams can melt steel notes))
  > Halfs the duration of the atom/note
- Arpeggio / Rolled Chords (squigle next to chord)
  > Notegroup-as-an-atom duration is kept, while instead of notes being played at the same time, they're played in quick succession


- Tenuto (above line)
  > Play note for full duration
    > (Maybe have a 'clear effects' modifier?)




- Check for two notes being played at the same time
    - (probably make it so it still plays the inner note)
